# Heart Disease – Machine Learning Classifier

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict heart disease using real patient data. Developed as part of an academic course, it includes data preparation, model training, evaluation, and interpretation.

## 📊 Project Objective

To explore the application of supervised learning techniques to real-world medical data, with the goal of predicting the presence or absence of heart disease.

## 📁 Files

- `SI-proj3-32.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing all code, data loading, model training and evaluation.
- `heart_1.txt`: Raw dataset with multiple patient entries.
- `heart_ivs.txt`: Processed version of the dataset used for model training.
- `SI-Projecto3 - Aprendizagem Automática.html`: Exported report from the notebook for visualization without needing Jupyter.

## 🧠 Techniques Used

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature selection and transformation
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)

## 💻 Technologies

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib / seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Results

The notebook demonstrates how different classifiers perform on the dataset, with metrics to compare their effectiveness in a healthcare context.

## 🚧 Limitations

- Dataset may be synthetic or limited in scope (not medically validated).
- No deployment or interactive interface provided.
